# First-golang-project-ToDoList-
In version 2.1 i change type of my list. In the last version 2.0 list have type  slice. Now he have type map with name in index. With this update i can easily search task that i need or check, have been another task before with this title.
I also create my router and split my handler to many handlers. Router help me with the distribution of handlers.
And i add Mutex and RWMutex in my handlers to escape race condition.
